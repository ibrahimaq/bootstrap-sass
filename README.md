# Bootstrap and SCSS
This is one of my first projects using Bootstrap and SCSS. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practise and apply my skills after having learnt Bootstrap and SASS/SCSS.

## Choice of theme
I wanted to create a simple and colourful layout that is some what to different to the typical 'business-type' theme/layout. I believe that a visit-a-farm website would definitely have aesthetic feel to it - particularly the soil colours e.g. brown (mud), green (plants) and yellow (sunflowers).  I kept the design simple so I can focus on the learning curve of Bootstrap and SASS.

# Things to improve on
1. Add more accessibility features e.g. img descriptions and alt
2. Apply some interactivity using JavaScript e.g. pop-ups and better mobile navbar functionality
3. Add animations
